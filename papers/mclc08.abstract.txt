We present an open source translation system that provides a clean-room implementation of the hierarchical phrase-based statistical translation model introduced in Chiang (2005) and refined in Chiang (2007). To our knowledge this is the first freely available hierarchical phrase-based translation system which implements cube pruning. We introduce extensions to Chiang (2007) to take advantage of multiple source languages.
