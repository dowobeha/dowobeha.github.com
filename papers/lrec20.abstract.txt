St. Lawrence Island Yupik is an endangered polysynthetic language of the Bering Strait region.
While conducting linguistic fieldwork between 2016 and 2019, we observed substantial support within the Yupik community for language revitalization and for resource development to support Yupik education.
To that end, Chen and Schwartz (2018) implemented a finite-state morphological analyzer as a critical enabling technology for use in Yupik language education and technology.
Chen and Schwartz (2018) reported a morphological analysis coverage rate of approximately 75% on a dataset of 60K Yupik tokens, leaving considerable room for improvement.
In this work, we present a re-implementation of the Chen and Schwartz (2018) finite-state morphological analyzer for St. Lawrence Island Yupik that incorporates new linguistic insights; 
in particular, in this implementation we make use of the Paradigm Function Morphology (PFM) theory of morphology.
We evaluate this new PFM-based morphological analyzer, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms the existing analyzer of Chen and Schwartz (2018) with respect to accuracy and coverage rate across multiple datasets.
