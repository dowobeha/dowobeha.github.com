This invited talk examines the state of interactive MT and post-editing technologies,
and how they can and should be made available to human translators and post-editors.

Writing in 1980, roughly 25 years after the first machine translation experiments, 
Martin Kay published a critique of contemporary machine translation that called for the
development of co-operative human-machine translation systems.

Many of the techniques advocated by Kay (1980), including terminology management systems,
electronic dictionaries and concordances, have been widely incorporated into commercially
available computer-aided translation software.

Other techniques that follows the spirit of Kay's call for a translator's amanuensis are 
currently being explored by current research in interactive MT and post-editing.
