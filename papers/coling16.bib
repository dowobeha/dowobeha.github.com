  abstract  = {This paper presents a new memory-bounded left-corner parsing model for
	unsupervised raw-text syntax induction, using unsupervised hierarchical hidden
	Markov models (UHHMM). We deploy this algorithm to shed light on the extent to
	which human language learners can discover hierarchical syntax through
	distributional statistics alone, by modeling two widely-accepted features of
	human language acquisition and sentence processing that have not been
	simultaneously modeled by any existing grammar induction algorithm: (1) a
	left-corner parsing strategy and (2) limited working memory capacity. To model
	realistic input to human language learners, we evaluate our system on a corpus
	of child-directed speech rather than typical newswire corpora. Results beat or
	closely match those of three competing systems.},
