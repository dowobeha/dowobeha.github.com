This paper describes the AFRL statistical MT system and the improvements that were developed during the WMT14 evaluation campaign.

As part of these efforts we experimented with a number of extensions to the standard phrase-based model that improve performance on Russian to English and Hindi to English translation tasks.

In addition, we describe our efforts to make use of monolingual English speakers to correct the output of machine translation, and present the results of monolingual postediting of the entire 3003 sentences of the WMT14 Russian-English test set.
