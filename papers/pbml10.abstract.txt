While example-based machine translation has long used corpus information at run-time,
statistical phrase-based approaches typically include a preprocessing stage where an aligned
parallel corpus is split into phrases, and parameter values are calculated for each phrase using
simple relative frequency estimates. This paper describes an open source implementation of
the crucial algorithms presented in (Lopez, 2008) which allow direct run-time calculation of
SCFG translation rules in Joshua.
