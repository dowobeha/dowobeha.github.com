In this yearâ€™s WMT translation task, Finnish-English was introduced as a language pair of competition for the first time.

We present experiments examining several variations on a morphologically-aware statistical phrase-based machine translation system for translating Finnish into English.

Our system variations attempt to mitigate the issue of rich agglutinative morphology when translating from Finnish into English.

Our WMT submission for Finnish-English preprocesses Finnish data with omorfi (Pirinen, 2015), a Finnish morphological analyzer.

We also present results for two other language pairs with morphologically interesting source languages, namely German-English and Czech-English.
