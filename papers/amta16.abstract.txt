AMTA occupies a unique place among MT research conferences, with one eye trained on
the continuing development of novel research techniques and another on the practical
application of those techniques in the commercial and government arenas. This year's
research program reflects that diversity. This year we accepted 15 papers for oral
presentation out of a total of 29 submissions. The accepted papers cover a nice variety of
topics including low resource and interactive MT, post-editing, and domain adaptation.
Over the past two years, the machine translation research landscape has undergone a
rapid transition away from the phrase-based techniques that have been dominant for the
past 10+ years, and towards new methods using artificial neural networks. This year's
program reflects that trend, with a number of papers applying neural techniques across a
broad range of MT tasks.

As chairs of the research track, we would like to thanks all of the authors as well as the
many reviewers whose hard work enabled this conference. It has also been a great
pleasure to work with George Foster and the other members of the AMTA 2016 organizing
committee.

Please enjoy this year's AMTA research track.
